# Charm Framework

Welcome to the Charm - the magnetic PHP framework!

Charm is a blazing-fast PHP framework optimized for building business web 
applications and APIs. With its lightweight design and fast router, 
Charm is optimized for high-performance, making it a powerful tool for 
developers who need to build applications that can handle heavy loads with ease.

Charm provides its own Twig views, but it can also easily be used with a 
single-page JS app. The framework is built using a combination of popular libraries 
and slim, optimized solutions, including the Eloquent ORM for database tasks, 
Redis caching for high performance, and a built-in user and auth system.

Charm also includes many convenience functionalities without overloading it, 
such as Cron and Queue systems for scheduling tasks, and a great debugging help with Kint,
Whoops, and Debugbar. All app init data can be stored in a single file to increase boot 
up even more, and config files are in YAML. Modules and own packages based on this 
framework are easily possible and integrated into other projects in seconds.

But Charm is more than just a fast and powerful PHP framework. We've designed our 
documentation to be engaging and enjoyable to read. 
We believe that learning a new technology 
should be a fun and rewarding experience, and our documentation reflects that 
commitment to making the learning process as enjoyable as possible.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with PHP, 
Charm is the perfect tool for building high-performance web applications and APIs. 
With its slim, optimized design and powerful features, 
Charm is the ideal choice for developers who want to build fast, 
scalable, and maintainable applications with ease.
