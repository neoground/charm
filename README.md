## üåê About

Charm is a blazing-fast PHP framework optimized for building business web 
applications and APIs. With its lightweight design and fast router, 
Charm is optimized for high-performance, making it a powerful tool for 
developers who need to build applications that can handle heavy loads with ease.

Charm provides its own Twig views, but it can also easily be used with a 
single-page JS app. The framework is built using a combination of popular libraries 
and slim, optimized solutions, including the Eloquent ORM for database tasks, 
Redis caching for high performance, and a built-in user and auth system.

Charm also includes many convenience functionalities without overloading it, 
such as Cron and Queue systems for scheduling tasks, and a great debugging help with Kint,
Whoops, and Debugbar. All app init data can be stored in a single file to increase boot 
up even more, and config files are in YAML. Modules and own packages based on this 
framework are easily possible and integrated into other projects in seconds.

But Charm is more than just a fast and powerful PHP framework. We've designed our 
documentation to be engaging and enjoyable to read. 
We believe that learning a new technology 
should be a fun and rewarding experience, and our documentation reflects that 
commitment to making the learning process as enjoyable as possible.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with PHP, 
Charm is the perfect tool for building high-performance web applications and APIs. 
With its slim, optimized design and powerful features, 
Charm is the ideal choice for developers who want to build fast, 
scalable, and maintainable applications with ease.


##  üéâ Getting Started

Please see our [official documentation](https://neoground.com/docs/charm/index)
and its included [Getting Started Guide](https://neoground.com/docs/charm/start.installation).

### Requirements: Fuel for Your Galactic Adventure

To ensure a smooth journey with the Charm Framework, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- PHP 8.0 or later (8.1 / 8.2 preferred, ideally with Redis module)
- Composer
- Depending on your app:
    - Database: MariaDB, MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL or SQL Server
    - Redis

### Installation: As Easy as the Kessel Run

To install the Charm Framework, you first need to install Bob toolkit on your machine.

In a galaxy not so far away, Bob (short for Binary Operations Butler) was created
to serve as the ultimate command-line companion for Charm Framework developers.

Run the following command to install Bob:

```bash
curl -fSsL -o bob https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neoground/charm-toolkit/main/bob && chmod +x bob
sudo mv bob /usr/local/bin/bob
```

For more information on this, see the [Bob documentation](https://github.com/neoground/charm-toolkit).

Once installed, run the following command to create a new project:

```bash
bob new GalacticArchive
```

This command will generate a new project called `GalacticArchive` based on the [charm-wireframe](https://github.com/neoground/charm-wireframe)
template and put it in the new created directory `GalacticArchive`. The wireframe serves as
a foundation for all Charm Framework applications, empowering you to build incredible
web applications in the universe.

The setup assistant then guides you through the process.

### Configuration: Fine-Tuning the Hyperdrive

Now that your project is set up, you can check and adjust the global configuration
by navigating to the `app/Config` directory. For environment-specific settings,
explore the `app/Config/Environments/Local` directory.

The active environment is determined by the `app/app.env` file, which contains
the name of the environment in use. The auto setup process takes care of this for you.

### Web Server Setup: Powering Up the Millennium Falcon

To get your web server up and running, you might need to adjust its configuration.
The charm-wireframe comes with a sample `.htaccess` and `nginx.conf` file to help you get started.

For a local development server, simply type `bob serve` in the project directory, and you'll be good to go!

May the Force guide you, young Jedi!
